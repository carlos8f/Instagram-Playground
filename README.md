# Instagram Playground

A node.js app that interacts with the Instagram API.

Until I figure out a way to better handle the client_id
and secret without committing it, please dont kill my account :)

## Installation

Get a working copy of node.js and npm going.

Download and extract the tarball or git clone.

Run <code>npm install -d</code> to install dependencies.

Run <code>node app.js</code>

Enjoy.

Note:

There are currently two runtime modes: "production" and "developement".

The default is "development".

To run the app in production mode: <code>NODE_ENV="production" node app.js</code>
